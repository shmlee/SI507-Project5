I am accessing the Tumblr search API and gathering:
- Limited to 5 followers and I am going to search for...
- For each user, I will be accessing to follower's (whom I follow) name, title, url, and tags
- I will write 2 csv files, one for follower's name, title, and url. Other csv file will cache that include type of the blog, blog's name and also comprehesive tags that has "chocolate"
